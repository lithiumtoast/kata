## What's a kata?

A code kata is an exercise in programming for an already known solved problem which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition. A musician practices scales until she knows them cold, or martial artist practices combat movements until they are sticky. In the same way, a programmer practices a kata regularly until the thoughts, keyboard/mouse movements, and behaviours are synthesized into second nature skillful action.

### Kata's original meaning

The concept of a code kata is a bow to original sense of the word from Japanense culture which translates to "form". It refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of artistic (often martial arts) movements to be honed to asymptotic perfection. You learn and evolve a kata through the three stages known as [*shuhari*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) (守破離):

- *shu* (守). Translates to "obey", "keep intact", "to protect", "follow the rule". This is the stage where initial learning takes places such as getting to know or discover the fundamentals, techniques, heuristics, etc. Traditionally, learning is passed down from *sensai* (先生) "teacher" to *seito* (生徒) "student", or from *senpai* (先輩) "senior student" to *kōhai* (後輩) "junior student". The student being taught is non-deviant, loyal, and honourable to tradition aswell as to who came before so that the *kata* "form" may be absorbed. For *shu*, the student says *hai sensai* (はい先生) "yes, teacher."
  
- *ha* (破). Translates to "detach", "digress", "to frustrate", "break the rule". This is the stage where after being disciplined from dogma/tradition, you, the student, boil down your teacher's lessons for a *kata* "form" based on experimentations and personal experiences. The lessons are challenged, the reasons for things are questioned, the underlying theory/principles are learned. You develop impressive fluidity and flexibility with the skills, free from the bounds of convention while upholding the core/root principles. In essence, you discover the structure of knowledge to which where load-bearing walls are, what walls can be moved around, and what walls need stay fixed. For *ha*, the student asks *naze sensei* (なぜ先生) "why, teacher?"
  
- *ri* (離). Translates to "seperate", "to be set free", "transcendence", "be the rule". This is the stage where the *kata* "form" becomes second nature. The knowledge is mastered and thus you no longer need your teacher. You are able to act in freedom and possibly create an evolution of the *kata* "form" based on your own creativity, insight, and ingenuity. The teacher is now your peer, and in some ways flipped to become a student of yours. It is not uncommon that you will surpas your teacher in knowledge/skill; you have arrived, but your journey has just begun. This is the source of improvement for the art as a whole. For *ri*, the student says *sayōnara sensei* (さようなら先生) "goodbye, teacher."

While these stages are often presented and thought of linearly, they practically are found in day-to-day life in non-linear ways. It is common for *shu* to be within *ha*; for both *shu* and *ha* to be within *ri*.
